**Executive Summmary:**

In 2019, the world was shaken by the spread of COVID-19, leading to the movement of many jobs from in-person to online to allow work to continue despite lock downs to prevent the spread of the virus. In addition to slowing the spread of COVID-19, working online allowed for more flexible hours and no commute time. However, certain drawbacks from working at home, including the lack of a cooperative environment and the inabilities for some jobs to fully shift may cause remote work to only be a temporary response to COVID instead of a permanent societal shift. Our team aims to conclude whether or not the trend towards remote work will be a permanent addition to society by looking at data trends from five locations located in the United States and United Kingdom.

Using polynomial regression on city employment data, we determined predicted occupational growth/decline in the five cities; using remote-ready job estimated percentages for each occupation, an approximation for the percentage of jobs that are remote-ready by 2024 and 2027 were shown. In 2024, the percentages were as follows: Seattle (44.2%), Omaha (49.0%), Scranton (44.3%), Liverpool (21.4%), and Barry (46.8%); in 2027, the percentages were as follows: Seattle (43.1%), Omaha (48.0%), Scranton (42.9%), Liverpool (21.3%), and Barry (46.6%).

We next ran a probabilistic model that took in inputs of age, education level, location, job, individual stance on remote work, and date of employment; these values would help determine the probability that a person would work from home. We lastly consolidated these findings and connected them to socioeconomic problems to validate the efficacy of our regression and probabilistic algorithms. In order of remote working's impact from most to least, the cities are as follows: Barry, Omaha, Scranton, Seattle, and Liverpool. Wale's government push for remote work and Omaha's young and evolving population show these cities will be the biggest place for impact within the remote work industry.
